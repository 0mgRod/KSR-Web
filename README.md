This is the open-source code of KSR Web

## Guide for use:
1. Download the source code or go to releases and download from there
2. Double-click the brows.py and wait for the browser window to popup. It should look like a regular browser. Do not be mistaken by the black window. This is just the console.
3. It is ready for use. Depending on whether or not the homepage exists, it may seem like the homepage doesn't work.

Also, you can only enter URLs in the top URL bar.
